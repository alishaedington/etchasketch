# etchasketch
The goal of this project is to create and etch-a-sketch type program. The user will use their mouse to "draw" on a grid of divs that are loaded into the DOM using Javascript. This will require a container element in which the grid of divs will be loaded. I need this to be editable by the user, so they can change the size of their grid from a default, 16X16, to anywhere up to 64X64, allowing they to create more detailed drawing with the smaller div sizes. After the grid is created, I need to add a hover affect to each of the individual divs that change the color. This will create the drawing affect that we need. I also need to create a function that clears the divs and puts them back to their starting position. 

I just finished the project, and though it was difficult, it took much less time than any of the other projects have so far. There is definitely room for improvement, but for now, I went above and beyond for my skill level. I chose to have the size selection be on a range slider, allowing the user to select anywhere from 2 to 64 as a size for the grid. I also added a color selector, so the user can choose which color they want to draw with. The HTML is very minimal for what is going on on the page, but I guess that is the point of this project, to show us how to manipulate the DOM.
